# About

## The project's idea
To build a prototype system designed to manage and propagate state changes across different applications, specifically from a Java backend to C#, we need to consider several approaches.

## Technology Stack

- [ ] Java/Spring Boot: The backend is built using Java with Spring Boot
- [ ] REST API: Communication between the Java backend and C# frontend is handled via RESTful APIs
- [ ] C#/.NET
- [ ] Swagger/OpenAPI
